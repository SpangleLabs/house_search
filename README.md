# House search
Just a simple utility to search for houses, across zoopla and rightmove.

Can either use the zoopla API (if you have an API key less than 24 hours old), or web scrape.



# To-do
- [ ] Store properties which have been seen
  - [ ] List new properties since last search
- [ ] Ability to mark properties excluded, with reasons
- [ ] Key properties by link
- [ ] Watcher mode, alert on new properties

## Longer term
- [ ] Ability to mark properties as various stages (viewing requested, viewed, approved)
- [ ] Ability to add metadata to properties (distances, comments, etc)
